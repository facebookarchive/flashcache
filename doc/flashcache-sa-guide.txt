		FlashCache System Administration Guide
		--------------------------------------

Introduction :
============
Flashcache is a writeback block cache for Linux, built as a kernel module,
using the Device Mapper. This document is a quick admministration guide 
to flashcache.

Requirements :
============
Flashcache has been built and tested on 2.6.18 and 2.6.20. If you'd like
to build and use it on a newer kernel, please send me an email and I 
can help. I will not support older than 2.6.18 kernels.

Cache creation and loading using the flashcache utilities :
=========================================================
Included are 3 utilities - flashcache_create, flashcache_load and 
flashcache_destroy. These utilities use dmsetup internally, presenting
a simpler interface to create, load and destroy flashcache volumes.
It is expected that the majority of users can use these utilities
instead of using dmsetup.

flashcache_create : Create a new flashcache volume.

flashcache_create [-s cache size] [-b block size] cachedevname ssd_devname disk_devname
-s : cache size. Optional. If this is not specified, the entire ssd device
     is used as cache. The default units is sectors. But you can specify 
     k/m/g as units as well.
-b : block size. Optional. Defaults to 4KB. Must be a power of 2.
     The default units is sectors. But you can specify k as units as well.
     (A 4KB blocksize is the correct choice for the vast majority of 
     applications. But see the section "Cache Blocksize selection" below).
-f : force create. by pass checks (eg for ssd sectorsize).

Examples :
flashcache_create -s 1g -b 4k cachedev /dev/sdc /dev/sdb
Creates a 1GB cache volume with a 4KB block size on ssd device /dev/sdc
to cache the disk volume /dev/sdb. The name of the device created is
"cachedev".

flashcache_create -s 2097152 -b 8 cachedev /dev/sdc /dev/sdb
Same as above but units specified in sectors instead. The name of the 
device created is "cachedev".

flashcache_load : Load an existing flashcache volume.

flashcache_load cachedevname ssd_devname disk_devname

Example :
flashcache_load cachedev /dev/sdc /dev/sdb
Load the existing cache on /dev/sdc, calling the flashcache volume
cachedev.

flashcache_destroy : Destroy an existing flashcache. All data will be lost !!!

flashcache_destroy ssd_devname

Example :
flashcache_destroy /dev/sdc
Destroy the existing cache on /dev/sdc. All data is lost !!!

Removing a flashcache volume :
----------------------------
Use dmsetup remove to remove a flashcache volume. Note that the 
default behavior on a remove is to clean all dirty cacheblock to
disk. The remove will not return until all blocks are cleaned.
Progress on disk cleaning is reported on the console (also 
see the "fast_remove" flashcache sysctl).

A reboot of the node will also result in all dirty cache blocks being
cleaned synchronously (again see the note about "fast_remove" in the
sysctls section).

Example:
dmsetup remove cachedev

This removes the flashcache volume name cachedev. Cleaning
all blocks prior to removal.

Cache Stats :
===========
Use 'dmsetup status' for cache statistics.

'dmsetup table' also dumps a number of cache related statistics.

Examples :
dmsetup status cachedev
dmsetup table cachedev

Flashcache errors are reported in 
/proc/flashcache_errors

Flashcache stats are also reported in 
/proc/flashcache_stats 
for easier parseability.

Cache Blocksize selection :
=========================
Cache blocksize selection is critical for good cache utilization and
performance. 

For the majority of filesystems and applications, a 4KB blocksize 
works well and is the right choice.

Some applications use a larger blocksize. In such cases, 
*with O_DIRECT and XFS*, it is possible (and beneficial) to use
a larger flashcache blocksize (to match the application blocksize).
Note that the blocksize must be a power of 2.

An example, MySQL/InnoDB uses 16KB blocksize by default. In this cases, 
*with O_DIRECT and XFS*, we can use a 16KB flashcache blocksize. 
If we do this, it is critical to tune XFS's stripe unit (su) to 16KB, 
and set the stripe width accordingly (man 8 mkfs.xfs). Setting the 
stripe unit to 16KB will result in XFS sending down 16KB multiple IOs.

# mkfs.xfs -f -d su=16384,sw=40 /dev/cciss/c0d1p4

This sets the stripe unit to 16KB and the stripe width to 
640KB (16KB * 40).

FlashCache Sysctls :
==================
These sysctls will apply to all cache devices on the node.

dev.flashcache.fast_remove:
	Don't sync dirty blocks when removing cache. On a reload
	both DIRTY and CLEAN blocks persist in the cache. This 
	option can be used to do a quick cache remove. 
	CAUTION: The cache still has uncommitted (to disk) dirty
	blocks after a fast_remove.
dev.flashcache.zero_stats:
	Zero out all cache stats reported by "dmsetup status".
dev.flashcache.reclaim_policy:
	FIFO (0) vs LRU (1). Defaults to FIFO. Can be switched at 
	runtime.
dev.flashcache.write_merge:
	Enable write merging. When cleaning blocks tack on any
	contigous blocks in the set to the ones that are being cleaned
	Defaults to on.
dev.flashcache.dirty_thresh_pct:
	Flashcache will attempt to keep the dirty blocks in each set 
	under this %. A lower dirty threshold increases disk writes, 
	and reduces block overwrites, but increases the blocks
	available for read caching.
dev.flashcache.do_sync: 
	Schedule cleaning of all dirty blocks in the cache. 
dev.flashcache.stop_sync: 
	Stop the sync in progress.

There is little reason to change these :

dev.flashcache.max_clean_ios_set:
	Maximum writes that can be issues per set when cleaning
	blocks.
dev.flashcache.max_clean_ios_total:
	Maximum writes that can be issued when syncing all blocks.
dev.flashcache.debug:
	Enable verbose debugging.
dev.flashcache.do_nc_pid_expiry:
	Enable expiry on the list of non-cacheable pids.
dev.flashcache.nc_pid_expiry_secs:
	Set the expiry on the list of non-cacheable pids.
dev.flashcache.max_nc_pids:
	Maximum number of non-cacheable pids.

Using dmsetup to create and load flashcache volumes :
===================================================
Few users will need to use dmsetup natively to create and load 
flashcache volumes. This section covers that.

dmsetup create device_name table_file

where

device_name: name of the flashcache device being created or loaded.
table_file : other cache args (format below). If this is omitted, dmsetup 
	     attempts to read this from stdin.

table_file format :
0 <disk dev sz in sectors> flashcache <disk dev> <ssd dev> <flashcache cmd> <blksize in sectors> [size of cache in sectors] [cache set size]

flashcache cmd: 
	   1: load existing cache
	   2: create cache
	   3: force create cache (overwriting existing cache). USE WITH CAUTION

blksize in sectors:
	   4KB (8 sectors, PAGE_SIZE) is the right choice for most applications.
	   See note on block size selection below.
	   Unused (can be omitted) for cache loads.

size of cache in sectors:
	   Optional. if size is not specified, the entire ssd device is used as
	   cache. Needs to be a power of 2.
	   Unused (can be omitted) for cache loads.

cache set size:
	   Optional. The default set size is 512, which works well for most 
	   applications. Little reason to change this. Needs to be a
	   power of 2.
	   Unused (can be omitted) for cache loads.

Example :

echo 0 `blockdev --getsize /dev/cciss/c0d1p2` flashcache /dev/cciss/c0d1p2 /dev/fioa2 2 8 522000000 | dmsetup create cachedev

This creates a cache device called "cachedev" (/dev/mapper/cachedev)
with a 4KB blocksize to cache /dev/cciss/c0d1p2 on /dev/fioa2.
The size of the cache is 522000000 sectors.

(TODO : Change loading of the cache happen via "dmsetup load" instead
of "dmsetup create").

Non-cacheability ioctls :
=======================
When doing backups or full database table scans, often we want
IOs to be non-cacheable by flashcache. 

Flashcache provides support (via ioctls) to mark all IOs for 
tagged processes be non-cacheable. (Note that this only works
for O_DIRECT IOs. For buffered IOs, pdflush, kswapd would 
also do the writes, with flashcache caching those).

The following ioctls are supported on /dev/mapper/<cachedev>

FLASHCACHEADDNCPID: add the pid to the list of pids tagged for
non-cacheable IOs.
FLASHCACHEDELNCPID: remove the pid from the list.
FLASHCACHEDELNCALL: remove all registered non-cacheable pids. 
This can be used to cleanup if a process dies.

Security Note :
=============
With Flashcache, it is possible for a malicious user process to 
corrupt data in files with only read access. In a future revision
of flashcache, this will be addressed (with an extra data copy).

Not documenting the mechanics of how a malicious process could 
corrupt data here.

You can work around this by setting file permissions on files in 
the flashcache volume appropriately.
